# SmartTraffic-DQN  
A Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based traffic signal optimization system to reduce congestion and improve traffic flow.

## Features  
- **Custom Gym Environment**: Simulates a traffic signal with dynamic traffic conditions.  
- **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**: Implements reinforcement learning for optimal signal control.  
- **Experience Replay**: Improves training stability and efficiency.  
- **Epsilon-Greedy Exploration**: Balances exploration and exploitation.  
- **Performance Visualization**: Plots reward progression, action distributions, and traffic density trends.  

## Results
The training process is logged, and key metrics like rewards, epsilon decay, and traffic densities are visualized using Matplotlib.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenAI Gym
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## To-Do
- Improve reward function for better traffic flow.
- Integrate with real-world traffic data.
- Extend to multi-intersection control.
